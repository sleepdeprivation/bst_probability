# Note

I usually put a "garbage" heading at the bottom of things I write in latex, so I don't lose things (I guess I'm a pack rat). Everything under "garbage" is not meant to make any sense, and just consists of snippets I discarded during work. Sometimes I even do this when writing e.g. C++, by putting a block comment at the bottom and writing "garbage","graveyard", etc
